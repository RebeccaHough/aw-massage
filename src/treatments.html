			<p>Any treatment will be tailored to your individual requirements. If you want specific areas focused upon, for example tense shoulders, just specify this during consultation.</p>
			
			<p>Regular treatments will help improvement last and retain the relaxed feeling.</p>

			<h2 id="swedishMassage">Swedish Massage</h2>
			
			<p>This is the most common and well-known type of massage, sometimes called the classic massage. The therapist starts the massage with superficial strokes to relax the client and to accept the feeling of the therapist's hands. Then firmer pressure is applied using different types of movements to manipulate the tissue. Massage oil is used to facilitate the stroke applied. It relaxes and promotes a feeling of wellbeing. If you have tense and tight muscles or just feeling stressed and tired, this is an excellent treatment.</p>
			
			<p><b>The benefits are:</b></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Helps relaxations and relieves stress</li>
				<li>Boosts blood circulation, increasing flow of oxygen and nutrients to cells and tissue</li>
				<li>Restore flexibility to muscles and joints</li>
				<li>Relieves muscular tension</li>
				<li>Stimulates the lymphatic flow, thus elimination of toxins</li>
				<li>Reduces pain by stimulating release of endorphins - natural painkiller</li>
				<li>Improves skin tone</li>
				<li>Improves sleep</li>
				<li>Relieves stress-related conditions such as headaches and migraines</li>
				<li>Strengthens your immune system</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2 id="deepTissueMassage">Deep Tissue Massage</h2>
			
			<p>Deep tissue is designed to release tension in the muscle and fascia. To access the deeper layers of muscle the forearm, knuckles and elbow are used to relax, lengthen and release holding patterns. The alleviation of pain, bringing about better posture, more flexibility, and fluid movement - these are all potential goals that are possible to achieve with deep tissue skills. People who experience chronic pain, or do lots of sports, or have sustained physical injuries would benefit from this treatment. Due to its deep and focused work it has a longer lasting effect.</p>
			
			<p><b>The benefits are:</b></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Encourages deep relaxation</li>
				<li>Relieves chronic tension, breaks up adhesions caused by micro-scarring</li>
				<li>Enhance function of muscles and joints</li>
				<li>Aids the healing process</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="advancedClinicalMassage">Advanced Clinical Massage</h2>
			
			<p>Advanced clinical massage is designed to assist the healing process and to target muscle imbalance and dysfunction. It incorporates various techniques during a treatment to give the most effective result possible. The aim is to get people painfree or reduce it significantly. This will improve the quality of life, increase range of motion, improve posture and wellbeing. <br>
			This treatment requires a firm pressure but it is also very therapeutic. The focus will be in areas with tenderness or tender spots, as well as other relevant areas, to release tension. Most conditions can benefit from clinical massage, whether they are chronic or persistant pain. <br>
			Remember that pain conditions will not usually go away in one session. For the best results it is recommended to have regular massage treatments to help with your wellbeing.</p>
			
			<p><b>Techniques used in advanced clinical massage:</b></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Sports massage</li>
				<li>Myofascial release</li>
				<li>Trigger point therapy</li>
				<li>Amma fusion (shiatsu)</li>
				<li>Sports stretching - PNF, AIS, passive</li>
				<li>Deep tissue work </li>
			</ul>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2 id="hotStoneMassage">Hot Stone Fusion Massage</h2>
			
			<p>Hot stone massage offers a fusion of specialised Eastern and Western advanced stone techniques. Soothing stones are incorporated into the massage to treat sport injuries, chronic pain or just as the ultimate luxury treatment.</p>
			
			<p><b>Therapeutic effects of heat:</b></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Very effective for injury rehabitation and chronic pain.</li>
				<li>Has a 'feel good' factor about it and takes relaxation to the 'next level' which makes it easier to work deeply in a gentle and more effective way.</li>
				<li>Reduces muscle tightness which is often the primary cause of pain and pain referring trigger points.</li>
				<li>Increases circulation thus bringing fresh blood and nutrients to the affected area. This helps stimulate tissue repair.</li>
				<li>Alters the sensation of pain as it stimulates the sensory receptors in the skin and reduces the transmission of pain signals to the brain.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><b>Cold stones (hydrotherapy) is an ideal treatment for acute injuries:</b></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>To prevent and reduce swelling</li>
				<li>Decrease inflammation</li>
				<li>Decrease pain</li>
				<li>Reduce muscle soreness</li>
				<li>Increase mobility</li>
				<li>Decrease spasm</li>
				<li>Heal quicker</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><b>Hot and cold contrast applications:</b></p>
			
			<p>These cause dilation and constriction of the blood vessels and lymph vessels which creates a 'pumping action' that increases circulation and improves many of the neurological responses that will create the best environment for healing. Contrast bathing is effective for long term chronic pain.</p>
			
			<p>The combination of different approaches within a treatment will gain maximum results. <br>
			Self care is an important part of treatment, in addition to massage; exercise and movement is recommended to reduce pain and improve function.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2 id="scarTissueMassage">Scar Tissue Release Massage</h2>
			
			<p>Our body has an amazing ability to heal itself but sometimes after an injury, illness, surgery or other medical treatments scar tissue and adhesions are formed. The inflammatory process and the  production of scar tissue is part of the healing. However, if these scars are not treated, they may lead to future long term problems. <br>
			Scars are often the underlying course of chronic pain or lack of mobility. Symptoms can include physical imbalance, postural misalignment and muscle atrophy.</p>
			
			<p>Scar tissue work through massage can be a very effective way of helping to treat and relieve these symptoms by decreasing pain, improving range of motion of a joint and  improving appearance.</p>
			
			<p>Sometimes a physical scar can hide other emotional issues where massage can also be of benefit. <br>
			Treatments can usually start 6-8 weeks after healing but will vary from client to client. If in doubt please check with your doctor/surgeon. A minimum of 6 treatments are required depending on the depth and width of the scar and how old it is. With newer scars the techniques will be more gentle and only last a few minutes. A combination of techniques is normally recommended, these include  <u>heat, myofascial release and stretching</u>.</p>
			
			<p><b>Scar tissue and adhesions that can be worked on:</b> <br>
			(but are not limited to the following)</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Caesarean</li>
				<li>Hysterectomy</li>
				<li>Masectomy</li>
				<li>Back and hip surgery</li>
				<li>Burns</li>
				<li>Appendectomy</li>
				<li>Thyroidectomy</li>
				<li>Falls and accidents</li>
			</ul>
